# Feature Scaling and Neural Network Optimization

This project demonstrates how to balance feature dominance in a neural network using feature scaling, backpropagation, and regularization techniques. It includes steps for building a neural network from scratch and visualizing decision boundaries.

## Key Features
- Synthetic binary classification dataset (`make_moons`).
- Feature scaling to address dominance of Feature 1.
- Manual implementation of forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.
- L2 regularization for improved generalization.
- Visualization of decision boundaries and loss curves.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results
- Improved test accuracy after scaling Feature 1.
- Balanced decision boundary between Feature 1 and Feature 2.
